# Practice

The scope of this repository is to aggregate all of the students work so it can be reviewed 
by the trainers. 

## Working with this repository

You will have to fork this repository and then make a clone of your own fork.
The repository contains a branch for each student. e.g. student name = Andrei Popescu, then
the branch name will be `pandrei`.

Your main branch will be the branch having your name with which you can play around.   

To get your code up to this repo you will have to push the branch on your repo and create a `Pull
request ` to your branch from this repo . 
In this way, the trainers will be able to see your changes clearly.
You are encouraged to do so for every main topic, e.g. java, java8, spring, etc.
