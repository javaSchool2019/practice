# Practice

The scope of this repository is to aggregate all of the students work so it can be reviewed 
by the trainers. 

## Working with this repository

You will have to fork this repository and then make a clone of your own fork.
The repository contains a branch for each student. e.g. student name = Andrei Popescu, then
the branch name will be `pandrei`.

Your main branch will be the branch having your name with which you can play around.   

To get your code up to this repo you will have to push the branch on your repo and create a `Pull
request ` to your branch from this repo . 
In this way, the trainers will be able to see your changes clearly.
You are encouraged to do so for every main topic, e.g. java, java8, spring, etc.

## Week1 Java Basics 2: Generics tasks

1. **hardcore**: prove that a generic class bytecode is the same as a normal class code. hints: javap
1. Implement Shippable interface in 3 different ways. You may use classes already in the project
1. I want to make the fruit price to be an integer but the bottle type to be double or float. do so but using the same product class
1. Implement a limited container that holds just a certain amount of objects (or maybe just a certain value). You may do this with a repository too with caching. 
1. do use a lower bound within your project or using existing classes
1. idea to extend skeleton: a yellow page may contain companies phone numbers -> these contain a list of person's phone numbers or other companies phone numbers. You may use wildcards here too.
